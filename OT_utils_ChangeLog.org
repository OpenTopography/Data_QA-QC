*  Routines to add:
   -  Check that DSM > DEM.  Randomized points along surface and sample.
   -  Add routine to create set of randomized points in the boundary and
      sample the rasters.  Verify that DSM > DTM.
   - for PDAL boundaries - need to put in checks for geometry errors.
   - module to merged shapefiles - may already have one in my utils..
   - check for multiple image formats.. (use set command)
   - problems with Dissolve.  Need to check for errors.  sometimes it
     will jsut write out a dbf, and give no error
   - all modules should probably take full path.  Then I can have a
     separate module that will split paths and return basename,
     dirname, filename without suffix, suffix only, etc.
   -  For LAS conversion, may need to add a las2las version because
      PDAL seems to give errors  when lastools doesn't.
   -  when working with the rasters, make sure to have an option to add compression
   -  May need to put in a check that header variables haven't been
      changed from the originals?  Or could just do a comparison using this
      code to make sure the versions are the same?
   - get this command into the rasters:
     gdal_translate -of GTIFF -co "COMPRESS=LZW" -co "TILED=YES" -co
     "blockxsize=128" -co "blockysize=128" TEST.flt
     TEST_GDAL_LZW_TILE_xyblock.tif
   -  how to deal with the Boundary Creation better - when are there too
      many points? (NZ18_Marlbo).
   -  Fix issues with ADDCRS2LAZ
